### [Apache Spark - Similar Movies Finder](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/spark-movielens)

- Brief overview:   Apache Spark was used to process a large volume of data by using an EMR cluster on AWS. The objective was to analyze 27 million movie ratings for 58,000 movies provided by 280,000 users and find the most similar movies to a selected movie.
- Technology used: *AWS (EMR on EC2, S3), Apache Spark, pyspark, python*
